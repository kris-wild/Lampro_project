# Thermal developmental environments do not affect thermal physiology: An experimental test and meta-analysis in reptiles

# Analysis - metadata
The scripts "Thermal_gradient.R" & "CTmax.R" is all code used for experimental study. Each script contains BRMS model structures, and their appropriate checks to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology in L. delicata. Script "meta-analysis.R" has all the code used for meta-analysis for reptiles to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology across age class, taxa, and latitude. Headings will provide detail of code that follows. Information has been saved for each final analysis which was then used in the .rmd file. All raw data used for scripts can be found in folder "Final.Analysis.Data". All saved BRMS & meta-analysis models can be found in folder "Final.Models". All figures (and supplementary figures) used in manuscript can be found in "Final.figures" folder. 

# Rmd file
rmd file has results, figures, and tables as appeared in the text. Code chunks detail analysis that is being conducted for each section.
