# Thermal developmental environments do not affect thermal physiology: An experimental test and meta-analysis in reptiles

# Data files

All raw data used for scripts can be found in folder "Final.Analysis.Data".

### Experimental Data

### Meta-analysis Data

# Analysis files
All saved  meta-analysis models can be found in folder "Final.Models". 
### Experimental Analysis
The scripts "Thermal_gradient.R" & "CTmax.R" is all code used for experimental study. Each script contains models fit, and their appropriate checks to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology in *L. delicata*.

### Meta-analysis

The  "meta-analysis.R" script has all the code used for meta-analysis for reptiles to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology across age class, taxa, and latitude. Headings will provide detail of code that follows. 


# Figure Files
 All figures (and supplementary figures) used in manuscript can be found in "Final.figures" folder. 

# Rmd file
Information has been saved for each final analysis which was then used in the .rmd file. The rmd file has results, figures, and tables as appeared in the text. Code chunks detail analysis that is being conducted for each section.
