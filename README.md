# Data files
All raw data used for scripts can be found in folder "Final.Analysis.Data".In this folder you will find raw data used for analysis,script, and figures for CTmax "CTmax_datasheet_2020.csv"; Tpref "Tpref_datasheet_2020.csv" and meta analysis "Final_Meta_results_extracted_data.csv". The descriptions for each column heading for raw data can be found in the csv file Data_file_column_names.csv.  Finally, in this folder is an rds file "Meta_df_rmdfile.rds" which is the meta-analysis extracted data that was used in the results .rmd file.

### Experimental Data - L. delicata 
Experimental data for CTmax and Tpref can be found in folder F"inal.Analysis.Data". CT max data used to measure *L. delicata* if file "CTmax_datasheet_2020.csv" and Tpref for *L. delicata* is "Tpref_datasheet_2020.csv". 

### Meta-analysis Data - Reptiles
Extracted meta analysis results can be found in folder "Final.Analysis.Data" and file name is "Final_Meta_results_extracted_data.csv". 

### Experimental Analysis -script
The scripts for experimental analysis can be found under the folder name "R". The script name is "L_delicata_Experimental_analysis.R" and contains script for both CTmax and Tpref models. Script contains model fit, and their appropriate checks to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology in *L. delicata*.

### Meta-analysis - script
The  "meta-analysis.R" script has all the code used for meta-analysis for reptiles to test if developmental environments/maternal investment influences thermal physiology across age class, taxa, and latitude. Headings will provide detail of code that follows. 

# Final files
All saved models (CTmax, Tpref, & meta-analysis) can be found in folder "Final.Models" and are saved as .rds files. There you will find a model folder that describes models of interest. Meta-analysis models can be found in folder "Meta_analysis_models". CTmax models can be found in folder "CTmax_models" and Tpref models can be found in folder "Tpref_models". 

# Figure Files
 All figures (and supplementary figures) used in manuscript can be found in "Final.figures" folder. These are knited in the rmd file. 

# Rmd file
Information has been saved for each final analysis which was then used in the .rmd file - "Results.Rmd". The rmd file has results, figures, and tables as appeared in the text (including supplementary figures and tables). Code chunks detail analysis that is being conducted for each section.
